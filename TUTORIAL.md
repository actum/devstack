# Tutorial - Creating your first app

Make sure you checked the [prerequisites](https://github.com/actum/devstack/blob/f45d6d19e8a0fb81605a8b0fd93548d07d0bcc35/README.md#prerequisites)!

## Checkout

To start your `my-app` project, you have to clone the Devstack repository.
Then just go into the directory and install dependencies with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
Be patient, it will take few minutes. There are some postinstall tasks that
will be auto executed by yarn.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:actum/devstack.git my-app
cd my-app
yarn
```
